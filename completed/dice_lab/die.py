Lab - Dice

Make a package of dice rolling utilities.
* Make a simple Die class for the basic rolling of a die
* Make D6 (six-sided) and D20 (twenty-sided) subclasses
* Each Die instance will have a roll() method, returning a random
  number between 1 and the number of sides on that die.
* When one die instance is added to another die instance, roll() is
  called on both instances and the results added together.
* When a die instance is added to an integer, the instance's roll()
  method is called, and the result is added to the integer.
